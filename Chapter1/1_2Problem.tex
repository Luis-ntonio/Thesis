Despite the advancements of LLMs in various sectors, they often struggle with domain-specific tasks without precise and targeted training. A significant problem in e-commerce is the interaction with detailed product information due to the lack of high-quality, focused datasets. This deficiency affects the models' ability to accurately extract and normalize product attribute values, leading to suboptimal product reviews and recommendations. Additionally, the diverse structure and content of product data on e-commerce platforms pose a challenge. There is a pressing need to create and utilize datasets that cater specifically to the structure and nuances of product data, particularly in JSON format, to enhance the performance of LLMs in accurately processing and generating structured data.
