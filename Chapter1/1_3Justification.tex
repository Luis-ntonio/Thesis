According to Macková and Pilát \cite{macková2023promap}, the key challenge in leveraging LLMs effectively in e-commerce and other sectors is the absence of high-quality, focused datasets, especially concerning product characteristics. This gap hinders the models’ ability to interact efficiently with detailed product information. Fine-tuning pre-existing models with specialized datasets is a strategic approach to enhance model performance and meet domain-specific needs.
