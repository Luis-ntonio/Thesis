Our main contributions are as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item We present eC-Tab2Text, a novel domain-specific dataset for Table-to-text generation in the e-commetce domain. The dataset features attribute-rich product tables paired with user-specific queries and outputs.

    \item We fine-tune open-source LLMs on the eC-Tab2Text dataset, resulting in significant improvements in text generation performance across various metrics.
    
    \item We provide a detailed analysis of domain robustness by comparing models trained on eC-Tab2Text with those trained on QTSumm, hightlightning the critical need for domain-specific datasets to achieve superior performance in e-commerce applications.
\end{itemize}
