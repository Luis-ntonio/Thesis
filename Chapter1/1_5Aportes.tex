Our main contributions are as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item We introduce the domain-specific e-commerce product collection known as the eC-Tab2Text dataset. The dataset is intended to produce thorough, attribute-specific product assessments and uncover important product qualities.

    The superiority of eC-Tab2Text in addressing domain-specific issues, such as varied product qualities and user-centric searches, is demonstrated by comparison with state-of-the-art datasets.
    
    \item With the use of eC-Tab2Text, we optimize LLMs to produce more thorough and contextually correct evaluations. It shows notable gains in performance compared to baselines for state-of-the-art text production.
