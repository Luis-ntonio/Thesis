Tabular data, including product descriptions and features, is a major component of e-commerce, although natural language is used for most user interactions, such as Q\&A and helper agents. The need for models that can efficiently interpret tabular data and engage consumers through logical, context-aware communication is thus urgent.
\\

In order to meet this need, table-to-text creation is essential, particularly in e-commerce, where it makes it possible to provide user-specific summaries, customized descriptions, and product reviews. The ability to convert structured patient records into succinct summaries for physicians \citep{he2023survey} and turn tabular financial data into analytical reports \citep{Varshney_2024} are two examples of industries that possess this capability in addition to e-commerce. Despite its benefits, creating text that is both comprehensible and appropriate for the context from structured data is still quite difficult, especially when coordinating input data and goal outputs with user-specific needs.
\\

User or query-centric scenarios, which require high-quality datasets that capture domain-specific perspectives, exacerbate these difficulties. The depth needed for specialized applications such as product reviews is typically absent in existing table-to-text datasets, which tend to concentrate on general-purpose summaries \citep{mackov√°2023promapdatasetsproductmapping}. The utility of datasets such as QTSUMM \citep{zhao2023qtsummqueryfocusedsummarizationtabular} for attribute-specific product reviews is limited because they provide tabular summaries that are unrelated to the product domain. Product-specific text production, on the other hand, needs to take into account a variety of characteristics (such as battery life and display quality) and adjust to different user intents, including offering technical details or condensed pros and drawbacks.

Different studies have abroad the challenges of generating text from tabular data. Fine-tuned models like Mistral\_Instruct \citep{jiang2023mistral} and StructLM \citep{gao2024jsontuning} have improved performance on table-based datasets by using training data tailored to specific domains. In the specific case of StructLM \cite{zhuang2024structlm}, it's knowledge remains in the studies of different \textit{Structured Knowledge Grounding} \cite{xie2022unifiedskgunifyingmultitaskingstructured}. Meanwhile, general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and BERT have shown impressive capabilities in generating text \citep{openai2024gpt4technicalreport, devlin2019bertpretrainingdeepbidirectional}. However, mostly tabular datasets lacks in the ability for capture key values to use it in the generation of text, something necessary for the e-commerce domain.
\\

In the recent years, some advances has shown in tabular datasets. ROTOWIRE \citep{wiseman2017challengesdatatodocumentgeneration} is a dataset focused on generates sports summaries, TabFact \citep{2019TabFactA} is design to evaluate fact-checking and WikiTableT \citep{chen2021wikitabletlargescaledatatotextdataset} focuses on creating descriptions from Wikipedia tables. But these datasets don't provide the depth needed for generating product-specific text. Other datasets, such as ToTTo \citep{parikh2020tottocontrolledtabletotextgeneration} and LogicNLG \citep{chen2020logicalnaturallanguagegeneration}, focus on logical deductions and advanced sentence generation but they still showing significant problems of for product-related tasks. This problems increase the needs for domain-specific datasets tailored to product reviews and attribute-based summaries as shows in recent reasearchs \citep{He2023ReviewOS}.
\\

This paper introduces a tailored table-to-text dataset for the products domain and explores the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to bridge the gap between general-purpose capabilities and domain-specific needs. By leveraging domain-specific datasets and fine-tuning techniques, this work aims to empower e-commerce platforms to generate more precise and engaging product reviews given user aspects and tables (see Figure \ref{fig:task-def}), enhancing customer satisfaction and business outcomes.
