\subsection{General Objective}
Present a dataset for domain-specific in e-commerce applications, \textbf{eC-Tab2Text}, to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate and product reviews.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recolect data of product specifications and reviews from pricebaba\footnote{\url{https://pricebaba.com/}} to create the \textbf{eC-Tab2Text} dataset.
    \item Use the \textbf{eC-Tab2Text} dataset to fine-tune open-source LLMs: LLama2-chat, Mistral Instruct, and StructLM.
    \item Use text-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, BERTScore) and model-based metrics (Faithfulness, fluency, correctness) to evaluate the performance of the fine-tune models 
    \item To evaluate the models' robustness across several datasets, do cross-validation with QTSUMM dataset.
\end{itemize}
