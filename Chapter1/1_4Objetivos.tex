\subsection{General Objective}
using the \textbf{eC-Tab2Text} dataset to refine Large Language Models (LLMs) in order to provide precise, attribute-specific product reviews from tabular data that is structured.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create the \textbf{eC-Tab2Text} dataset, paying particular attention to capture user-centric searches and comprehensive product attributes.
    Use the \textbf{eC-Tab2Text} dataset to fine-tune LLMs, such as LLama2-chat, Mistral Instruct, and StructLM.
    \item Use metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, together with fidelity and accuracy, to assess the refined models.
    \item To evaluate the models' resilience across several datasets, including QTSUMM and \textbf{eC-Tab2Text}, do cross-validation.
    \item Showcase notable enhancements in the models' capacity to process and produce text that is pertinent to the context of e-commerce applications.
\end{itemize}
