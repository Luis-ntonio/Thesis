\subsection*{Genetal Objective}
The primary objective of this project is to refine product recommendations based on the specifications of a product in e-commerce by enhancing the accuracy of product reviews and focused reviews. 
\subsection*{Specific Objectives}
Specifically, this project aims to fine-tune LLMs like LLama2-chat, Mistral Instruct, and StructLM with a bespoke, product-related JSON dataset. This will enable proficient analysis and processing of JSON-formatted product data, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant product reviews. The initiative also seeks to compare the improved performance of these trained models against baseline models, demonstrating significant enhancements in handling structured product data based on the metrics of hallucination, fluency, and relevance.
