\subsection*{Genetal Objective}
The primary objective of this project is generate a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of generating product reviews based on tabluar data representing product features. 
\subsection*{Specific Objectives}
Specifically, this project will create a product-related JSON dataset to fine-tuning LLMs like LLama2-chat, Mistral Instruct, and StructLM. The trained models will be evaluated based on the metrics of hallucination, fluency, and relevance, demonstrating significant improvements in handling structured product data.
