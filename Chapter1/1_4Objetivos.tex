\subsection*{Genetal Objective}
The primary objective of this project is generate product reviews based on tabluar data representing product features. This will be achieved by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a product-related JSON dataset, and evaluating the models based on hallucination, fluency, and relevance.
\subsection*{Specific Objectives}
Specifically, this project will create a product-related JSON dataset to fine-tuning LLMs like LLama2-chat, Mistral Instruct, and StructLM. The trained models will be evaluated based on the metrics of hallucination, fluency, and relevance, demonstrating significant improvements in handling structured product data.
