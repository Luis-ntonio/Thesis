\subsection{Genetal Objective}
The primary objective of this project is generate product reviews based on tabular data representing product features using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLama2-chat, Mistral Instruct, and StructLM.
\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhance the models' ability to interact efficiently with detailed product information.
    \item Create a product-related JSON dataset to fine-tune the LLMs LLama2-chat, Mistral Instruct, and StructLM.
    \item Train the models using the product-related JSON dataset.
    \item Evaluate the trained models based on the metrics of faithfullness, correctness, and text-based metrics.
    \item Applied cross-validation to the models to ensure the results are consistent.
    \item Demonstrate significant improvements in handling structured product data.
\end{itemize}
