\section{Future Work}
Based on the results of this research, some possible directions for future work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhance language models using a larger dataset. Due to constraints imposed by Kaggle, the training and testing dataset was limited to 1000 examples each. Using a larger dataset could potentially yield better results.
    \item Refine language models with a dataset of mobile product reviews from various sources. This diversification could enhance the models' ability to generalize.
    \item Improve language models with product review data across different categories. Expanding the dataset to include varied product categories could also enhance model generalization.
    \item Develop alternative methods to assess the coherence of generated reviews. Manual review of generated content is not scalable, and the metrics currently used to assess model hallucination may not be effective. Implementing new methods could lead to a more accurate evaluation of the models.
\end{itemize}
