\section{Conclusions}
This study highlights the impact of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using the eC-Tab2Text dataset, a domain-specific resource for e-commerce applications. By consolidating structured product data and addressing limitations of datasets like QTSUMM, eC-Tab2Text enables robust, attribute-specific product reviews. Fine-tuning models such as LLama2-chat, StructLM, and Mistral\_Instruct significantly improved text-based and model-based metrics, with Mistral\_Instruct consistently outperforming others. These findings validate the importance of tailored datasets in enhancing LLM performance and pave the way for future expansions into broader product categories and dynamic workflows.
