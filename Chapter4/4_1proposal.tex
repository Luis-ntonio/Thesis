This section describes the methods and procedures used for generating product reviews on e-commerce platforms through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). It covers all stages of the process, from data collection and preparation to the evaluation of the fine-tuned models.
\\\\
Since the dataset has been generated from scratch, the procedure for data acquisition and generation is detailed, as well as the cleaning and structuring of the data. The techniques used for model tuning are then described, including the selection of hyperparameters and optimization methods. Finally, the evaluation metrics used to analyze the outcomes are presented.
\\\\
Figure \ref{fig:MethodologyFlowchart} displays a flowchart that summarizes the methodology followed in this study. The explanation begins the esxtraction of the data to generate the first dataset followed by the data cleaning and structuring. In parallel, the generation of prompts of the second dataset is explained. The next step is the fine-tuning of the LLMs, followed by the evaluation of the models. The final step is the analysis of the results and the discussion of the findings.
\\\\
This comprehensive approach ensures a systematic and thorough exploration of the potential and limitations of LLMs in generating meaningful and reliable product reviews, highlighting both the technological advancements and the practical challenges encountered during implementation.
