  abstract = {The recent focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded unprecedented discussion of their potential use in various domains, including healthcare. While showing considerable potential in performing human-capable tasks, LLMs have also demonstrated significant drawbacks, including generating misinformation, falsifying data, and contributing to plagiarism. These aspects are generally concerning but can be more severe in the context of healthcare. As LLMs are explored for utility in healthcare, including generating discharge summaries, interpreting medical records and providing medical advice, it is necessary to ensure safeguards around their use in healthcare. Notably, there must be an evaluation process that assesses LLMs for their natural language processing performance and their translational value. Complementing this assessment, a governance layer can ensure accountability and public confidence in such models. Such an evaluation framework is discussed and presented in this paper.}

Thus the need to fine-tune an extremely large pretrained model with a limited training corpus arises in various downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet effective fine-tuning technique, Child-Tuning, which updates a subset of parameters (called child network) of large pretrained models via strategically masking out the gradients of the non-child network during the backward process. Experiments on various downstream tasks in GLUE benchmark show that Child-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla fine-tuning by 1.5 8.6 average score among four different pretrained models, and surpasses the prior fine-tuning techniques by 0.6 1.3 points. Furthermore, empirical results on domain transfer and task transfer show that Child-Tuning can obtain better generalization performance by large margins.",

abstract="Despite the advancements made in ecommerce technologies over the past years, the inability to define and exchange semantically rich and accurate product information among ecommerce websites/applications has continued to intrigue researchers. This problem has taken on greater urgency because it impedes the realization of the full benefits of Ecommerce 3.0. The present research conceptualizes, designs and implements a cloud computing-based platform that enables global merchants to maintain a collaborative Electronic Product Catalog (EPC) known as Productpedia. This collaborative EPC platform addresses numerous shortcomings of prior researches by (1) maintaining a single centralized EPC database; (2) negating the need to synchronize and convert data; (3) creating an integrated meta-model ontology for merchants to define previously unclassified product information without the involvement of domain experts; and (4) enabling an Open Application Programming Interface based on RESTful web services to facilitate direct modification of the EPC database by even third-party applications.",

abstract = {Internet users actively search for trending products on various social media services like Instagram and YouTube which serve as popular hubs for discovering and exploring fashionable and popular items. It is imperative for e-commerce giants to have the capability to accurately identify, predict and subsequently showcase these trending products to the customers. E-commerce stores can effectively cater to the evolving demands of the customer base and enhance the overall shopping experience by offering recent and most sought-after products in a timely manner. In this work we propose a framework for predicting and surfacing trending products in e-commerce stores, the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. We begin by defining what constitutes a trending product using sound statistical tests. We then introduce a machine learning-based early trend prediction system called TrendSpotter to help users identify upcoming product trends. TrendSpotter is a unique adaptation of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime modelciteInceptionTime that predicts the future popularity of a product based on its current customer engagement, such as clicks, purchases, and other relevant product attributes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through A/B tests, where we first showcase the effectiveness of our statistical test based labeling strategy, resulting in an incremental sales lift of 59 bpsfootnotebps or basis points are a measure of percentages. 1 bps = 0.01\% across two experiments on home page and search page. Subsequently, we conduct a comparison between our machine learning model and the statistical labeling baseline and observe an additional sales gain of 14 bps, reflecting the importance of early identification of trending products.},

    abstract = "In recent years, researchers tend to pre-train ever-larger language models to explore the upper limit of deep models. However, large language model pre-training costs intensive computational resources, and most of the models are trained from scratch without reusing the existing pre-trained models, which is wasteful. In this paper, we propose bert2BERT, which can effectively transfer the knowledge of an existing smaller pre-trained model to a large model through parameter initialization and significantly improve the pre-training efficiency of the large model. Specifically, we extend the previous function-preserving method proposed in computer vision on the Transformer-based language model, and further improve it by proposing a novel method, advanced knowledge for large model{'}s initialization. In addition, a two-stage learning method is proposed to further accelerate the pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments on representative PLMs (e.g., BERT and GPT) and demonstrate that (1) our method can save a significant amount of training cost compared with baselines including learning from scratch, StackBERT and MSLT; (2) our method is generic and applicable to different types of pre-trained models. In particular, bert2BERT saves about 45{\%} and 47{\%} computational cost of pre-training BERT$_{\rm BASE}$ and GPT$_{\rm BASE}$ by reusing the models of almost their half sizes.",

We find that pre-trained representations are most effective when added to the encoder network which slows inference by only 14{\%}. Our experiments in machine translation show gains of up to 5.3 BLEU in a simulated resource-poor setup. While returns diminish with more labeled data, we still observe improvements when millions of sentence-pairs are available. Finally, on abstractive summarization we achieve a new state of the art on the full text version of CNN/DailyMail.",

    abstract = "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in reasoning tasks with dedicated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Further enhancing CoT prompts with exquisite exemplars can significantly improve reasoning performance.However, the effectiveness of CoT prompts may fluctuate dramatically with different choices of in-context examples. Additionally, manual construction of rationale steps can be time-consuming, presenting challenges for the widespread adoption of CoT prompting. In this work, we propose a novel approach by introducing information entropy (IE) as a criteria on for CoT prompt selection. We extend this criterion to the CoT generation and inference stages, automatically generating CoT prompts with higher information entropy scores and adaptively determining the number of samples. These three stages together form our proposed information- entropy-based multi-step reasoning for large language models, named INFORM. Our experiments across seven reasoning benchmarks utilizing two language models(GPT-3.5-Turbo and text-davinci-003) demonstrate the superiority of INFORM both in performance and efficiency.",
