  abstract = {The recent focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded unprecedented discussion of their potential use in various domains, including healthcare. While showing considerable potential in performing human-capable tasks, LLMs have also demonstrated significant drawbacks, including generating misinformation, falsifying data, and contributing to plagiarism. These aspects are generally concerning but can be more severe in the context of healthcare. As LLMs are explored for utility in healthcare, including generating discharge summaries, interpreting medical records and providing medical advice, it is necessary to ensure safeguards around their use in healthcare. Notably, there must be an evaluation process that assesses LLMs for their natural language processing performance and their translational value. Complementing this assessment, a governance layer can ensure accountability and public confidence in such models. Such an evaluation framework is discussed and presented in this paper.}

    abstract = "Recent pretrained language models extend from millions to billions of parameters. Thus the need to fine-tune an extremely large pretrained model with a limited training corpus arises in various downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet effective fine-tuning technique, Child-Tuning, which updates a subset of parameters (called child network) of large pretrained models via strategically masking out the gradients of the non-child network during the backward process. Experiments on various downstream tasks in GLUE benchmark show that Child-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla fine-tuning by 1.5 8.6 average score among four different pretrained models, and surpasses the prior fine-tuning techniques by 0.6 1.3 points. Furthermore, empirical results on domain transfer and task transfer show that Child-Tuning can obtain better generalization performance by large margins.",
