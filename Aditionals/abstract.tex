\textit{Due to a dearth of domain-specific datasets, large language models' (LLMs') applicability in e-commerce is still understudied, despite their remarkable adaptability across a variety of domains. We provide eC-Tab2Text, a proprietary dataset created to capture the complexities of e-commerce, such as user inquiries and comprehensive product information, in order to close this gap. We concentrate on text generation from product tables using eC-Tab2Text, which enables LLMs to generate excellent, attribute-specific product reviews from structured tabular data. In addition to fidelity and fluency evaluations, fine-tuned models were thoroughly examined using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. Our findings show significant gains in producing contextually accurate evaluations, underscoring the revolutionary potential of customized datasets and fine-tuning techniques in streamlining e-commerce processes. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in e-commerce workflows and the essential role of domain-specific datasets in tailoring them to industry-specific  challenges.}
