\textit{Large Language Models (LLMs) have a wide range of applications across diverse fields such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. Each domain presents unique requirements, necessitating data in various formats. Among these, structured data has gained significant traction in recent years. Datasets like ToTTo and QTSumm leverage tabular data to summarize and enhance LLM comprehension and analytical capabilities. However, within the e-commerce domain, particularly in the context of product-human interaction, the availability of specialized datasets remains limited.}

\textit{To address this gap, we introduce eC-Tab2Text, a dataset designed to capture the complexities of key-value information in e-commerce product specifications. It facilitates the generation of meaningful reviews while maintaining coherence with human reasoning. This work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in e-commerce workflows and highlights the critical importance of domain-specific datasets in addressing industry-specific challenges.}
